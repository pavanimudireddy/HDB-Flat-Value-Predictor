# HDB-Flat-Value-Predictor
## Overview
Housing prices in Singaporeâ€™s HDB market fluctuate depending on multiple factors such as flat type, location, lease remaining, and floor area. This project leverages historical HDB resale data to predict resale prices using machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Predict HDB resale prices based on user input  
- Interactive interface for easy usage  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for accurate predictions  
- Supports multiple machine learning models  

## Dataset
