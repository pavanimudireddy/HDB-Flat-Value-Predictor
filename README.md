## üöÄ Project Overview
The **HDB Resale Price Predictor** is a web application that estimates resale prices of HDB flats in Singapore.  
It uses a trained **machine learning model** and an interactive **Streamlit interface** to provide instant predictions.

---

## üéØ Motivation
Singapore‚Äôs HDB resale market is fast-paced and complex. This app helps:  
- Buyers & sellers make **informed decisions**  
- Quickly estimate resale prices without manual research  
- Showcase **practical machine learning applications**

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Predict HDB resale price** in seconds using a trained machine learning model.
- **User-friendly interface** with interactive sidebar inputs.
- **Supports multiple flat types, models, and towns** in Singapore.
- **Flexible input options** including floor area, storey range, lease commencement, remaining lease, and transaction date.
- **Instant results** with a clear display of the estimated resale price.
---

## ‚ö° How It Works
1. **User Inputs**: Provide details such as block code, street code, flat type, flat model, town, floor area, storey range, lease start year, remaining lease, and transaction date.  
2. **Data Encoding**: Categorical values (e.g., flat type, flat model, town) are converted into numeric codes as required by the model.  
3. **Prediction**: The trained machine learning model (`resale_price_model.joblib`) predicts the resale price of the flat.  
4. **Output**: The app displays the predicted price in a **clear, formatted message**.
